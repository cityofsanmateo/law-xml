  <text>WHEREAS, the procedures set forth in Article XIIID ยง 6 of the California State Constitution (Proposition 218) for property-related fees apply to sewer service charge increases; and</text>
  <text>WHEREAS, the City is following the procedure set forth in Article XIIID ยง 6 for this Sewer Service Charge increase; and</text>
  <text>WHEREAS, notice of the proposed Sewer Service Charge increase was mailed to ratepayers and property owners on May 1, 2017; and</text>

  <text>WHEREAS, in accordance with Article XIIID ยง 6 of the California Constitution:</text>
  <text>The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge do not exceed the funds required to provide sewer service because the rate increase is needed to fund ongoing sewer system operation and maintenance and meet capital expenditures,</text>
  <text>The revenues derived from the Sewer Service Charge will not be used for any purpose other than the provision of sewer service,</text>
  <text>The Sewer Service Charge will not exceed the cost of sewer service attributable to each parcel,</text>
  <text>The Sewer Service Charge is only charged for sewer service that is actually used by or currently available to the parcel in question,</text>
  <text>The Sewer Service Charge pays for the provision of sewer service and not for general governmental services; and</text>
