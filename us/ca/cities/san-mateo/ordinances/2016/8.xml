  <section>
    <num>1</num>
    <heading>CITY COUNCIL MAKES THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS.</heading>
    <para>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>The provision of safe and stable housing for households at all income levels in essential for the public welfare of the City.  Housing in the City of San Mateo has become steadily more expensive and housing costs have gone up faster than incomes.  Federal and state government programs do not provide enough affordable housing to satisfy the needs of very low, low, or moderate income households.  As a result, there is a severe shortage of adequate, affordable housing for very low, lower, and moderate income households, as evidenced by the following findings in the City's 2015 – 2023 Housing Element:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Average market rents increased 24-31% between 2010-2013.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>More than 55% of low income renters and owners are cost burdened by paying more than 30% of their income for their housing; and 90% of very low income renters and 60% of very low income owners pay more than 50% of their income for their housing</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>Only 28.9% of the homes are affordable to purchase for median income households in the San Francisco, San Mateo County Division Metropolitan Statistical Area, which is the least affordable area in the state.</text>
      </para>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>As provided in the Housing Element of the General Plan, the City wishes to be a leader in providing resources to facilitate the development of housing, and especially affordable housing, within its borders as outlined in the Goal H.2 Encourage New Housing Construction, includingH-2.2 which calls for maintaining the housing/jobs balance and H-2.3 which calls for the use of public funds for affordable housing to assist low and moderate income households, giving priority to very low income housing. H-2.4 encourages the promotion of the private development of affordable housing through its inclusionary program, as well as consideration of the adoption of a commercial linkage fee.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(c)</num>
      <text>Because commercial development attracts employees, of whom a quantifiable number will have very low, low, or moderate incomes, new commercial developments increase the demand for and exacerbate the shortage of housing available for people at those levels while also reducing the supply of land potentially available for housing development.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(d)</num>
      <text>Based on the findings above, the City desires to further the public health, safety and welfare by requiring commercial development projects in the City to mitigate their impact on the need for affordable housing in the City.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>The City may adopt an affordable housing commercial linkage fee under the authority of the California Constitution Article XI, Section 7, which provides: "A county or city may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws," and in accordance with the findings set forth in the ordinance codified in <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="1">this Chapter</cite>.</text>
