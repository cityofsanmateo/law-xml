    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>on November 8, 2016, California voters will determine whether to approve Proposition 64 entitled "The Control, Regulate and Tax Adult Use of Marijuana Act" which, if enacted, would legalize the possession and use of marijuana by persons 21 years of age and older, and would make lawful, subject to state licensing, the cultivation, testing, and sale of nonmedical marijuana; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>Proposition 64 would add <cite doc="Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code" path="ยง26200">Section 26200</cite> to the <cite doc="Cal. Bus. &amp; Prof. Code">California Business and Professions Code</cite> which would authorize the City of San Mateo "to completely prohibit the establishment or operation of one or more types of [marijuana] businesses" made lawful by the proposition; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>Proposition 64 would add <cite doc="Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code" path="ยง11362.2">Section 11362.2</cite> to the <cite doc="Cal. Health &amp; Safety Code">California Health and Safety Code</cite> which would, among other things, permit individuals to grow for their personal use marijuana at their homes, but authorizes the city to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana outdoors upon the grounds of a private residence; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City Council has serious concerns about the cultivation, processing and sale of marijuana and marijuana products within the community and the outdoor cultivation of marijuana at private residences, including but not limited to, compatibility of these uses with sensitive neighboring uses, and potential security concerns with the open and obvious cultivation and sale of marijuana; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the San Mateo City Council is concerned that without carefully crafted, comprehensive local regulation these uses might have serious deleterious effects on the public peace, health, safety and general welfare of the city's residents, and the council has determined it needs sufficient time to study and consider the potential impacts of commercial marijuana enterprises before deciding whether to allow such uses within the community; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>pending the City's study of these issues, the City wishes to impose a moratorium on the establishment of commercial marijuana enterprises and the outdoor cultivations of marijuana at private residences; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City of San Mateo is a charter city; and</text>

    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text><cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Charter" path="2.16">City Charter section 2.16</cite> provides that any ordinance declared by the City Council to be necessary as an emergency measure for preserving the public peace, health, safety, or welfare and containing the reasons for its urgency, may be introduced and passed at one meeting.</text>

      <num>a.</num>
      <text>In accordance with <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Charter" path="2.15">City Charter Section 2.15</cite>, this Ordinance is necessary as an emergency measure to preserve the public health, safety, and welfare. If California voters approve Proposition 64, the commercial cultivation, processing, and sale of marijuana, as well as the cultivation for personal use of marijuana in one's private yard will be legal in the state.  These uses have the potential to have serious adverse impacts on the use of neighboring properties, including, the emission of nuisance odors, fire safety associated with the use of high intensity lighting, and security and public safety concerns associated with the open cultivation and sale of marijuana which has, and in the near term will continue to have, high dollar value in illicit markets.  In addition, these uses could have serious adverse impacts on the consumption of limited resources including excessive use of water and energy.</text>
