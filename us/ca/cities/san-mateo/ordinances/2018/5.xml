              <text>Before application submittal, the applicant must schedule and attend a pre-submittal conference with the Director for all proposed projects (a) subject to a major wireless permit; (b) that involve the deployment of more than five (5) facilities in the public right-of-way; or (c) that involve collocation, modification or other change to an existing concealed facility submitted with a request for approval pursuant to Section 6409. Pre-submittal conferences for all other proposed projects are strongly encouraged but not required. The pre-submittal conference is intended to streamline the review process through informal discussion that includes, without limitation, the appropriate project classification and review process, any latent issues in connection with the proposed or existing wireless tower or base station, including compliance with generally applicable rules for public health and safety; potential concealment issues or concerns (if applicable); coordination with other City departments responsible for application review; and application completeness issues. To mitigate unnecessary delays due to application incompleteness, applicants are encouraged (but not required) to bring any draft applications or other materials so that City staff may provide informal feedback and guidance about whether such applications or other materials may be incomplete or unacceptable. The Department shall use reasonable efforts to provide the applicant with an appointment within five (5) working days after receiving a written request and any applicable fee or deposit to reimburse the City for its reasonable costs to provide the services rendered in the pre-submittal conference.</text>

          <heading>AMORTIZATION OF NONCONFORMING WIRELESS FACILITIES.</heading>
          <text>Any non-conforming wireless facilities in existence at the time <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="17.10">this Chapter</cite> becomes effective must be brought into conformance with <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="17.10">this Chapter</cite> in accordance with the amortization schedule in this Section.  As used in this section, the "fair market value" will be the construction costs listed on the building permit or application for the subject wireless facility and the "minimum years" allowed will be measured from the date on which <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="17.10">this Chapter</cite> becomes effective.</text>

          <text>The Director may grant a written extension to a date certain when the wireless facility owner shows: (1) a good faith effort to cure non-conformance; (2) the application of this section would violate applicable laws; or (3) extreme economic hardship would result from strict compliance with the amortization schedule. Any extension must be the minimum time period necessary to avoid such extreme economic hardship. The Director may not grant any permanent exemption from this section.</text>
          <text>Nothing in this section is intended to limit any permit term to less than ten (10) years. In the event that the amortization required in this section would reduce the permit term to less than 10 years for any permit granted on or after January 1, 2007, then the minimum years allowed will be automatically extended by the difference between ten (10) years and the number of years since the City granted such permit. Nothing in this section is intended or may be applied to prohibit any collocation or modification covered under 47 U.S.C. ยง 1455(a) on the basis that the subject wireless facility is a legal nonconforming wireless facility.</text>
