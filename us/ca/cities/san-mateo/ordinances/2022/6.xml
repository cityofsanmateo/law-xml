      <text>Every person in the City of San Mateo ("City") has a fundamental right to privacy, protected not only by the United States Constitution, but also explicitly guaranteed in <cite doc="Cal. Const." path="I-1">Article I, Section 1 of the California Constitution</cite>. This right to privacy includes the right to  all legal health care services, including reproductive health care services.</text>

      <text>The City Council desires to amend <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="10">Title 10</cite> entitled "Peace, Safety and Morals" of the City's Municipal Code by adding <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="10.90">Chapteaccessr 10.90</cite> in its entirety, entitled "Access to Reproductive Health Care Facilities."

      <text>In developing this Ordinance, the City Council is mindful of the legal principles relating to regulation of activity in public forums such as sidewalks, streets and public parks. The City Council does not intend to unconstitutionally suppress or infringe expressive activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or the Liberty of Speech Clause of the California Constitution, but instead is enacting reasonable content-neutral time, place and manner regulations.  These regulations address the need to prevent:  harassment and intimidation within eight (8) feet of a person accessing reproductive health care facilities within 100 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health care facility; and the obstruction of access to a reproductive health care facility.</text>

      <text>The City Council in enacting this Ordinance does hereby take legislative notice of the various principles and decisions regarding buffer zone restrictions at reproductive health care facilities, First Amendment rights and the regulation of public assemblies, including but not limited to, the following:  <em>Hill v. Colorado </em>(2000) 530 U.S. 703; <em>McCullen v. Coakley </em>(2014) 573 U.S. 464; <em>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network of W. New York</em> (1997) 519 U.S. 357; <em>Reed v. Town of Gilbert, Ariz</em>. (2015) 576 U.S. 155; <em>Hoye v. City of Oakland </em>(9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2011) 653 F.3d 835; <em>United States v. Grace </em>(1983) 461 U.S. 171; <em>Police Dep't of Chicago v. Mosley </em>(1972) 408 U.S. 92, 95; and <em>Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr., Inc.</em> (1994) 512 U.S. 753.</text>

    <para>
      <num>(e)</num>
      <text>The City Council also takes legislative notice of the State of Colorado regulation prohibiting efforts to obstruct, detain, hinder, impede, or block another person's entry to or exit from a health care facility, as well as knowingly approach within eight feet of a person, unless such person consents, for the purpose of engaging in specified conduct within one hundred feet of the entrance to a health care facility, validated by the Supreme Court in <em>Hill v. Colorado</em> (2000) 530 U.S. 703. The City Council also takes legislative notice of the City of Oakland regulation prohibiting efforts to knowingly and willfully approach within eight feet of a person or vehicle occupant seeking entry to a reproductive health clinic if the purpose is to counsel, harass, or interfere with such person or vehicle occupant, validated by the Ninth Circuit in <em>Hoye v. City of Oakland </em>(9<sup>th</sup> Cir. 2011) 653 F.3d 835. The City Council also takes legislative notice of the ordinances protecting the constitutional right to access reproductive health care facilities enacted by the City of San Francisco and the City of Napa that prohibit following or harassing conduct within 25 feet and 30 feet of a reproductive health care facility, respectively, and prohibit impeding access to or exit from a reproductive health care facility.  The City Council also takes legislative notice of the City of Walnut Creek ordinance prohibiting efforts to willfully and knowingly approach within eight feet of a person or vehicle occupant seeking entry to reproductive health care facility, within 100 feet of the entrance, if the purpose is to harass or intimidate such person or vehicle occupant, and prohibiting the obstruction of access to or departure from the facility.</text>

      <text>The function of a buffer zone restriction at a reproductive health care facility is to prohibit specific conduct which may obstruct, deter, delay, or prevent individuals from obtaining or providing necessary reproductive health care services because they are otherwise forced to endure harassing, obstructive or intimidating behavior. These factors lead to increased patient stress that may affect the efficacy and complication rate of the medical care sought within and can adversely affect the physical and emotional health and well-being of patients seeking services at a reproductive health care facility.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(g)</num>
      <text>The City finds that continued incidences and harassment on and in front of the Planned Parenthood property in San Mateo raise serious and alarming safety concerns regarding the constitutionally protected right to access reproductive health care facilities. The City's Police Department has received several calls for service since 2014 about protest-related incidents, including but not limited to: a report of a woman jumping in front of a moving vehicle to prevent a patient from entering the parking lot; a report of protestors blocking the driveway leading into the clinic, thereby obstructing vehicular traffic on Baywood Avenue; a report of a person dressed in a white doctor-style coat in front of the facility and aggressively engaging with people entering the facility; a report of a protestor grabbing the arm of a person who was escorting a patient from the parking lot into the facility; a report of a person wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope who flagged down a patient entering the facility claiming that they were a doctor with Planned Parenthood; and a report of a car blocking the driveway of the facility parking lot due to a protestor yelling at the driver, who was as a result blocking a third party from walking down the sidewalk.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(h)</num>
      <text>On May 16, 2022, members of the public spoke at the City Council meeting when this ordinance was introduced and described their experience with protestors in front of Planned Parenthood, which included regularly encountering a person in a lab coat trying to block the facility driveway, and observing protestors standing on stools on the sidewalk screaming at people entering the facility.  Written comments included observations of said protestors holding signs in front of vehicles attempting to pull into the facility parking lot.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(i)</num>
      <text>The City has determined that delaying action on further consideration of this Ordinance until additional incidences and harassment in front of Planned Parenthood occur or escalate does not adequately protect the constitutional rights of these individuals to access reproductive health care services, and that it is instead appropriate to enact basic protections against harassment, intimidation and obstruction in regards to accessing reproductive health care facilities.</text>
    </para>

      <num>(j)</num>
      <text>The City desires to enact narrowly-tailored content neutral regulations to protect the right to access reproductive health care services by enacting restrictions on conduct that obstructs access to reproductive health care services by creating an eight-foot buffer for a person accessing the facility when the person is within 100 feet of the entrance to the reproductive health care facility.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(k)</num>
      <text>By enacting this Ordinance, the City Council does not intend to interfere with the exercise of free speech rights of those engaged in protesting outside of reproductive health care facilities. Rather, <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="1">this Chapter</cite> only regulates harassment and intimidation within eight feet of the person within 100 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health care facility, and obstructing access, to protect both the rights of those seeking access to reproductive health care services, and those who gather outside of reproductive health care facilities in the City to speak on matters of public concern. The City has determined based on empirical evidence, including ordinances adopted by sister jurisdictions, that creating an eight-foot buffer around a person when that person is within 100 feet of the entrance to a health care facility minimizes, reduces and/or eliminates harassing, intimidating and/or obstructing conduct while at the same time still allowing any protected expressive activity to occur in close enough proximity to reach the intended audience.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(l)</num>
      <text>The City finds that the modest scope of the Ordinance prohibiting harassing and intimidating individuals within eight feet of the person, within 100 feet of the entrance to a reproductive health care facility, and obstructing access, are content-neutral and are narrowly-tailored restrictions that serve a significant governmental interest, but still provide alternative avenues of communication. The reasonable time, place and manner restrictions in this Ordinance avoid the negative effects of harassing, intimidating and obstructive conduct around reproductive health care facilities, without targeting the message or topic of speech. The restrictions are narrowly tailored and allow ample alternative means of communicating in the areas in front of reproductive health care facilities through consensual conversations that are not harassing or intimidating or through non-consensual conversations where there is an eight-foot distance between speaker and target audience to reduce or eliminate the harassing, intimidating or obstructing conduct accompanying any such speech. The application of this Ordinance to apply only to reproductive health care facilities, rather than health care facilities generally, further ensures narrow tailoring because reproductive health care facilities that are not part of a licensed hospital, and not owned or operated by a licensed hospital, are more vulnerable to such subversion of their patients' rights on account of the layout and design of their facilities and parking areas as well as their staff resources and deployment.</text>

            <text><cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="10.90" >This Chapter</cite> shall be known as the "Access to Reproductive Health Care Facilities Ordinance." The City Council finds that every person in the City of San Mateo has a basic and fundamental right to privacy protected by the United States Constitution and explicitly guaranteed in <cite doc="Cal. Const." path="I-1" alt_sec="SECTION">California's Constitution, Article 1, Section 1</cite>, including the right to seek and obtain all health care services permitted under the laws of the State of California. Central to this right is the need to secure access to all reproductive health care services. Access to these services is a matter of critical importance not only to the individual, but also to the health and welfare of all residents of the City of San Mateo and the region. Intentional efforts to harass an individual or prevent that individual from exercising his or her right to seek and obtain reproductive health care services are therefore contrary to the interests of the people of San Mateo.</text>
