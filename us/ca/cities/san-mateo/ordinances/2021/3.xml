    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the production, management, and consumption associated with disposable food service ware, typically used for only a few minutes before being discarded, have significant environmental impacts, including environmental contamination; consumption of precious resources such as energy and water; emissions of greenhouse gases; air and water pollution; litter on streets; and plastic pollution in waterways and oceans; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>disposable food service ware constitutes a substantial portion of the litter found within the City of San Mateo and the rest of the Bay Area.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>these types of food service ware are commonly littered or blown out of trash receptacles and migrate through the storm drain system where they eventually end up in local creeks and the San Francisco Bay; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>polystyrene is a petroleum-based, lightweight plastic material which was commonly used as food service ware by retail food vendors and became a problematic environmental pollutant given its non-compostable and nearly non-reusable nature; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the County of San Mateo first adopted an ordinance prohibiting food vendors from using polystyrene-based disposable food service ware in 2011; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City of San Mateo adopted the County of San Mateo ordinance by reference in City Ordinance 2013-6; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>since that time, the County of San Mateo has conducted extensive research on a new Disposable Food Service Ware Ordinance that would restrict plastic disposable food service ware in our community; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>effective ways to reduce the negative environmental impacts of disposable food service ware include, in order of priority, using reusable food service ware; using natural-fiber based compostable materials, many made from renewable resources such as bamboo, wheat stalk/stem, and sugarcane that do not contain toxic chemicals; and recycling food service ware; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>when products are reused and recycled, natural resources are spared, less energy is used for the production of new products, and premium landfill space is preserved; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>when compostable products are turned into compost, they can reduce water use and lessen the need for fertilizer at the site where the compost is applied (e.g., gardens, yards, farm land, etc.), which can also lead to cost savings since less or no fertilizers need to be purchased; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>compostable food service ware such as cups, plates, clamshell containers, and utensils are now made from paper, sugarcane stalk, bamboo, wheat stalk/straw, and other blends of natural plant fibers which pose less of a danger compared to plastic as they degrade; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>even with the emergence of compostable plastics, which are derived from renewable biomass sources such as plants and microorganisms, there are limited certified types of compostable plastic that biodegrade in a marine environment; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>certain disposable food service ware, including compostable paperboard containers, may contain fluorinated chemicals, also known as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS), which are synthetic chemicals commonly used in disposable food service ware to repel water and grease; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>fluorinated chemicals pose a public health risk as they have been linked to serious health effects including kidney and testicular cancer, thyroid disruption, delayed puberty, and obesity; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>plastics in waterways and oceans break down into smaller pieces, called microplastics, that do not biodegrade and are present in most of the world's oceans; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>reduction of disposable food service ware in the environment will advance compliance with federal, state, and county clean water mandates, including the City's Municipal Regional Stormwater Permit requirement, by helping to reduce trash and litter in stormwater discharges; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the County of San Mateo coordinated with a number of different entities, including local cities, county solid waste haulers, nearby industrial composting facilities, waste and stormwater-related joint powers authorities, restaurant and business associations, non-profit organizations, and educational institutions before drafting their ordinance; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>on February 25, 2020, the County of San Mateo Board of Supervisors repealed the 2011 polystyrene ban ordinance and replace it with a new Disposable Food Service Ware ordinance which would continue to restrict the use of polystyrene-based disposable food service ware and require food facilities to replace non-compostable or non-recyclable food service ware with compostable alternatives that are non-plastic, natural fiber-based and free of all intentionally added fluorinated chemicals where possible; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City of San Mateo wishes to follow the County of San Mateo and adopt an ordinance reducing plastic disposable food service ware by food facilities within the City.</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>NOW, THEREFORE,</conjunction>
      <text>THE COUNCIL OF THE CITY OF SAN MATEO ORDAINS AS FOLLOWS:</text>

            <text>Imposing the provisions of <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="5.89">this Chapter</cite> would cause significant economic hardship. "Significant economic hardship" may be based on, but not limited to, demonstrating that suitable Disposable Food Service Ware is not available at a commercially reasonable price and the additional cost associated with providing the Disposable Food Service Ware is particularly burdensome to the Food Facility based on the type of operation(s) affected, the overall size of the business/operation, the number, type and location of its facilities, the impact on the overall financial resources of the Food Facility, and other factors. Reasonable added cost for a suitable item as compared to a similar item that the Food Facility can no longer use shall not by itself constitute adequate grounds to support an exemption for such item. In determining whether a significant economic hardship has been established, the City shall consider the following information: ability of the Food Facility to recover the additional expense by increasing its prices; the availability of tax credits and deductions; outside funding; and other options.</text>
