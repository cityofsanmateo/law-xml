          <text>Successor's and Assignee's Responsibility and Liability. If any operator, while liable for any amount under <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="3.56">this chapter</cite>, sells, assigns, or otherwise transfers the hotel or quits the hotel, whether voluntarily or involuntarily, the operator's subsequent successor, assign, other transferee, or other person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the hotel, shall satisfy any transient occupancy tax liability owed to the city associated with the property. Failure to do so for the benefit of the city will result in the successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity obtaining ownership or control of the hotel being personally liable to the city for the full amount of the transient occupancy tax liability, which includes interest and penalties.</text>
        </para>
        <aftertext>The successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity seeking to obtain ownership or control of the hotel shall notify the Tax Collector of the date of transfer at least thirty days prior to the transfer date; or if the agreement to sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of the hotel was made less than thirty days prior to the date of transfer, notice shall be provided immediately.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity who obtains ownership or control of the hotel shall be deemed to have complied with the requirement of this section to satisfy the unpaid transient occupancy tax liability, if that person or entity complies with the requirements of California Revenue and Taxation Code Section 7283.5 by withholding from the purchase price an amount sufficient to cover the tax liability, or by otherwise paying the tax liability until the Tax Collector provides a transient occupancy tax clearance certificate showing that it has been paid and stating that no amount is due through the date of transfer.</aftertext>
        <aftertext>The Tax Collector, within ninety days of receiving a written request from a successor operator, assign, purchaser, transferee, or other person or entity who obtains or attempts to obtain ownership or control of the hotel, may issue a transient occupancy tax clearance certificate stating either the amount of tax liability due and owing for the property, or stating that there is no tax liability due and owing for the property. The Tax Collector may also request financial records from the current or former owner or operator to conduct an audit of the transient occupancy tax that may be due and owing. After completing the audit within ninety days after the date that the records were made available, the Tax Collector may issue a tax clearance certificate within thirty days of completing the audit, stating the amount of the tax liability owed, if any. If the city determines that the records provided for an audit are insufficient, the Tax Collector may rely on the facts and information available to estimate any transient occupancy tax liability associated with the property. The Tax Collector may issue a tax clearance certificate stating the amount of the tax liability, if any, based on such facts and information available. A written application for a hearing on the amount assessed on the tax clearance certificate must be made within ten days after the serving or mailing of the certificate. The hearing provision of Section 3.56.090 shall apply. If an application for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax clearance certificate shall serve as conclusive evidence of the tax liability associated with the property as of the date specified on the certificate.</aftertext>
