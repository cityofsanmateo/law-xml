    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City of San Mateo adopted a First Time Homebuyer (FTB) program in 1988 with the opening of 78 condominium units at Meadow Court, followed by 96 units at Gateway Commons the following year; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>in 1992, the City's Below Market Rate (BMR) inclusionary Program was adopted, which expanded opportunities for first time buyers and has provided 128 additional ownership units to the City's portfolio; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>

    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>units in both the FTB and BMR programs rely on recorded affordability restriction documents which set sales price restrictions and give the City the first option to purchase upon resale in order to ensure another eligible buyer purchases the units at an affordable price; and</text>
    </recital>
    <recital>
      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>the City's existing purchasing ordinance requires City Council approval for the purchase of real property; and</text>

      <conjunction>WHEREAS,</conjunction>
      <text>staff recommends revising the City's purchasing ordinance to codify a provision authorizing the City Manager or his or her designee to purchase affordable units for purposes of resale to qualified buyers;</text>
