            <num>(a)</num>
            <text>First Response. Upon a report of an unruly or potentially unruly gathering, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City may respond to the incident and make a preliminary determination as to whether the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering. If the officer or employee determines that the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may issue a written warning to the person apparently in charge of the gathering that contains information in substantial conformance to the following:</text>
            <para>
              <num>(1)</num>
              <text>The conduct of the gathering constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering under the Municipal Code or State law; and</text>

            <para>
              <num>(3)</num>
              <text>If an officer or employee responds to the gathering again in order to seek the abatement of the conduct or manner of the gathering, the full costs to the City of that response or any further response may be charged to the owner, tenant or occupant of the property on which the gathering is occurring, as well as to the person in charge of the property and the person who organized the gathering.</text>

            <text>Second and Further Responses. If, after a first notice has been given as provided above, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City responds to a gathering that is then an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may take such further abatement steps as the officer or employee believes reasonable to abate the unruly gathering as provided by State and City laws. The response costs of those abatement steps may be compiled and reported to the City Manager for hearing and assessment of the response costs against the property owner as provided in <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="7.42">Chapter 7.42</cite>.</text>
