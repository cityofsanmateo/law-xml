    <heading>Legislative Findings.</heading>
    <text>At a duly noticed public hearing on June 17, 2024, the City Council of the City of San Mateo reviewed and considered the accompanying staff report and attachments thereto, the exemption from environmental review, together with comments received during the public review process, and hereby finds and determines that the proposed ordinance is consistent with the adopted General Plan in that it supports the development of housing and achieves the General Plan's stated goals and policies.</text>
  </section>
  <section>
    <num>2</num>
    <heading>Environmental Determination.</heading>
    <text>In accordance with California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) Guidelines Section 15183, the zoning amendment to reclassify 200 S Fremont St. with the overlay district ("project") is exempt from further environmental review because the project is consistent with the Residential Medium II land use designation adopted as part of the General Plan 2040 for which an Environmental Impact Report (EIR) was certified by the City Council on March 18, 2024 and the allowed residential development density is also consistent with the development density established by zoning or general plan policies. There are no project specific effects that are peculiar to the project; there are no project specific impacts that the General Plan Update EIR failed to analyze as significant effects; there are no potentially significant off-site and cumulative impacts that the general plan EIR failed to evaluate; and there is no substantial new information which results in more severe impacts than anticipated by the general plan EIR, all as further explained in the CEQA memorandum attached to the staff report. Furthermore, any future development of the site pursuant to these code amendments would not constitute a "project" for purposes of Division 13 (commencing with Section 21000) of the <cite doc="Cal. Pub. Res. Code">Public Resources Code</cite> pursuant to <cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code" path="ยง65583.2|(i)">Government Code Section 65583.2(i)</cite>.</text>
