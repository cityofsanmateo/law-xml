    <text>A temporary moratorium on eviction for non-payment of rent by small business and nonprofit entity tenants impacted by the COVID-19 crisis is imposed as follows:</text>
    <para>
      <num>(a)</num>
      <text>During the period of local emergency declared in response to COVID-19, no landlord shall endeavor to evict a tenant in either of the following situations: (1) for nonpayment of rent if the tenant demonstrates that the tenant is unable to pay rent due to financial impacts related to COVID-19 or (2) for a no-fault eviction unless necessary for the health and safety of tenants, neighbors, or the landlord. A landlord who knows that a tenant cannot pay some or all of the rent temporarily for the reasons set forth above shall not serve a notice pursuant to <cite doc="Cal. Civ. Proc. Code" path="§1161|(2)">CCP 1161(2)</cite>, file or prosecute an unlawful detainer action based on a 3-day pay rent or quit notice, or otherwise seek to evict for nonpayment of rent. A landlord knows of a tenant's inability to pay rent within the meaning of this ordinance if the tenant, within 14 days after the date the landlord provides written notice of this emergency ordinance as required below, notifies the landlord in writing of lost income and inability to pay full rent due to financial impacts related to COVID-19, and provides documentation to support the claim. For purposes of this Ordinance, "in writing" includes email or text communications to a landlord or the landlord's representative with whom the tenant has previously corresponded by email or text. Any medical or financial information provided to the landlord shall be held in confidence, and only used for evaluating the tenant's claim. Nothing in this Ordinance shall relieve the tenant of liability for the unpaid rent, which the landlord may seek after expiration of the local emergency. Unless the tenant is able to demonstrate that they are unable to repay deferred rent six months after the local emergency is lifted, the tenant must pay all unpaid rent within six months of the date the local emergency is lifted. If after this initial six month period the tenant has demonstrated that they are unable to repay some or all of the unpaid rent, the tenant shall be entitled to another six months to pay all unpaid rent, provided that during this second six month period the tenant shall pay on a monthly basis at least 50% of the average monthly rent that has been deferred. A landlord may not charge or collect a late fee for rent that is delayed for the reasons stated in this Ordinance; nor may a landlord seek rent that is delayed for the reasons stated in this Ordinance through the eviction process.</text>
    </para>
    <para>
      <num>(b)</num>
      <text>Prior to taking any action, during the term of this emergency ordinance, to endeavor to evict a tenant for nonpayment of rent or under any circumstance that constitutes a no-fault termination of tenancy, the landlord must first provide the affected tenant or tenants with written notice of this emergency ordinance using a form developed and approved by the San Mateo City Attorney, which form shall include at a minimum (1) the amount of rent to which the landlord is legally entitled pursuant to any written or oral agreement and under the provisions of State or local law; (2) that this rent is due unless the tenant promptly establishes in writing to the landlord that the amount of rent due qualifies for deferral under this ordinance; and (3) that the notice from the tenant to the landlord of the deferral of rent payment must be provided to the landlord within fourteen (14) days of receipt from the landlord of the written notice required by the subdivision.</text>

      <text>Violations of this Ordinance shall be punishable as set forth in <cite doc="City of San Mateo, Cal., Code" path="1.04">Chapter 1.04 of the San Mateo Municipal Code</cite>. In addition, this Ordinance shall serve a defense in the event that an unlawful detainer action is commenced in violation of this Ordinance. In the event of a violation of this Ordinance, an aggrieved Tenant may institute a civil proceeding for injunctive relief, money damages of not less than three times actual damages (including damages for mental or emotional distress as specified below), and any other relief the Court deems appropriate.
