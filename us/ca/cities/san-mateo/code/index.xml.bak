          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>The City Council hereby finds that preserving integrity and openness in the political process is a matter of the highest public interest; that the people of the City of San Mateo can be better served through a more informed electorate; that the trust of the people is essential to representative government; and that regulation of certain campaign contributions and loans is necessary to promote public confidence in government and to protect the integrity of the electoral process.</text>

        <para>
          <num>(b)</num>
          <text>The City Council further finds that regulation of campaign contributions is required because the costs of running political campaigns have reached levels that lead to a public perception that special interests and wealthy individuals may have undue influence on or access to elected officials.</text>

          <text>The City Council further finds that allowing candidates to lend unlimited amounts of their personal funds to their campaigns tends to undermine public confidence in the election process, because the public may perceive that candidates with large outstanding loans will seek contributors to repay their loan after the election, and may be predisposed to favor their post-election contributors.</text>

        <heading>AMOUNT.</heading>
        <text>There is imposed on each deed, instrument or writing by which any lands, tenements, or other real property within the City are sold, granted, assigned, conveyed or otherwise transferred to, or vested in, the purchaser or purchasers, or any other person or persons when the consideration or value of the interest or property conveyed exceeds one hundred dollars, a tax at the rate of one-half of one percent of said consideration or value.</text>
        <text>As used herein, "consideration or value" means the total consideration, valued in money of the United States, paid or delivered or contracted to be paid or delivered in return for the transfer of real property, including the amount of any indebtedness, existing immediately prior to the transfer which is secured by a lien, deed of trust or other encumbrance on the property conveyed and which continues to be secured by such lien, deed of trust or encumbrance after said transfer, and also including the amount of any indebtedness which is secured by a lien, deed of trust or encumbrance given or placed upon the property in connection with the transfer to secure the payment of the purchase price or any part thereof which remains unpaid at the time of the transfer.</text>
        <text>"Consideration or value" also includes the amount of any special assessment levied or imposed upon the property by a public body, district or agency, where said special assessment is a lien or encumbrance on the property and the purchaser or transferee agrees to pay such special assessment or takes the property subject to the lien of such special assessment.</text>
        <text>The value of any lien or encumbrance of a type other than those which are hereinabove specifically included, existing immediately prior to the transfer and remaining after said transfer, shall not be included in determining the value of the consideration.</text>
        <text>If the consideration or value cannot be definitely determined, or is left open to be fixed by future contingencies, "consideration or value" shall be deemed to mean the fair market value of the property at the time of transfer after deducting the amount of any lien or encumbrance, if any, of a type which would be excluded in determining the consideration or value pursuant to above provisions of this section.</text>
        <text>The terms "real property" and "realty" shall be deemed to mean real property as defined by and under the laws of the state. (Ord. 1977-9 § 1, 1977; prior code § 34.01).</text>

Nothing in this section shall be deemed to require the substitution of the name of the City of San Mateo for the word "state" when that word is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, or the name of the State Treasury, or of the Constitution of the state of California; nor shall the name of the City be substituted for that of the state in any section when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the City or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter; and neither shall the substitution be deemed to have been made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such storage, use or other consumption remains subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of that code; and in addition, the name of the City shall not be substituted for that of the state in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 and 6828 of the said Revenue and Taxation Code as adopted, and the name of the City shall not be substituted for the word "state" in the phrase "retailer engaged in business in this state" in Section 6203 nor in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

          <text>"Inordinately high" means usage in one month that exceeds usage by 150% of the five months of average usage. An example follows. Usage for November is 37, December is 76, January is 20, February is 16, and March is 17. The five month average is 33.20. Usage in any one month in excess of 49.8 (i.e., 150% of 33.2) would be considered inordinately high.

        <text>The Council by ordinance will establish the annual charge to be assessed per 100 cubic feet of water used, upon the users thereof, for the privilege of the use of the sewer system and disposal facilities of the City for each fiscal year, to be effective 30 days after adoption.</text>
        <text>Each user will be assigned to one of the five customer classes as determined by the Director of Public Works in accordance with the principal activity conducted upon the premises, or in accordance with the use of the premises. Users with the same principal activity will receive the same customer classification. The five customer classes are hereby established as defined in Section 3.54.020(d) Definitions, and will be assessed a sewer service charge as described below. The purpose of the classification is to establish a sewer service charge system based upon flow and waste strength that will insure an equitable recovery of capital and operating costs.</text>
        <text>The sewer service charge is based on a rate and annual water usage. The total revenue raised will be determined based on winter water consumption. The "base sewer service charge rate" is established by adopting a rate based on the fund's financial plan and will be per 100 cubic feet of annual water used except as qualified as follows:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>

        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(d)</num>
          <text>The annual charge for each user shall be the sewer service user fee computed pursuant to this section or a minimum charge based on an average 2.5 CCF per month times the base rate, whichever is greater. The minimum charge will apply to all parcels with usage greater than zero during the year. In determining the usage, in cases where the five-month average is not representative of the actual average sewer use during the year, then the entire fiscal year water use record may be considered in determining the yearly usage.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(e)</num>
          <text>The City may enter into service contracts for establishment of an annual user charge that is different from the charge calculated pursuant to this section with other governmental entities or with users whose operations are determined to have unusual or unique circumstances related to return of water to the sewer system. Such a contract shall be subject to approval by the Director of Public Works and may be proposed at any time during the year.</text>
        </para>
        <text>Annual water usage, for the purpose of establishing this charge, shall be determined by computing the average monthly metered flow billed to each parcel, to the nearest 10 cubic feet, during the immediately past five months of November, December, January, February, and March, and multiplying this monthly average by 12, the total months in a year. The metered flow data billed for those months shall be that contained in the official records of the California Water Service Company, Estero Municipal Improvement District, Belmont Water District, or any entity or successor that provides water service to that particular parcel.</text>
        <text>In the event that billings show no water usage during any one or more of the specified five months, the average shall be computed by using the remaining months' usage and number that do show water usage.</text>
        <text>In the event that one month of the five specified months shows an inordinately high or low usage, that month shall be dropped from the calculation and the remaining four months' usage shall be averaged and multiplied by 12 to establish the charge.</text>
        <text>The water usage for each user shall be determined after March 31st of each year, but sufficiently prior to the Council's review pursuant to Section 3.54.070, to allow for public and Council study prior to the review.

Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of 30 days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may be considered.

        <heading>GENERAL TAX.</heading>
        <text>For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a general tax in the amount of 10% of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Collector may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Collector.

As soon as the Tax Collector procures such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, the Tax Collector shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Collector shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within 10 days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Collector for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Collector, shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Collector shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Collector shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after 15 days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.56.130. (Prior code § 58.5.09)</text>

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The purpose of this ordinance is to establish purchasing procedures for the City of San Mateo. The City Council finds that a flexible purchasing system that allows for consideration of price, quality, reliability, workmanship, compatibility of products (such as computers and cellular equipment or design and furniture), and other relevant factors is in the public's best interests and that no single factor should be determinative in every case.</text>
        <text>The City Council further finds that the complexity of City of San Mateo purchases and construction contracts, in conjunction with the complexities of the private marketplace, require that city staff and this Council have flexibility to select among the purchasing alternatives set forth in this ordinance in order to obtain the best products, services, and construction in the public's interest.

        <heading>FIRST FILING—DECLARATION FOR ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATE.</heading>
        <text>Upon a person filing a business tax return for the first time in the City, or for a newly established business, he or she shall furnish to the bureau, for its guidance in ascertaining the amount to be paid by the applicant business, a written return under penalty of perjury, upon a form provided by the bureau, setting forth such information as may be therein required as may be necessary properly to determine the amount of the license tax to be paid by the business.</text>
        <text>If the amount of the tax to be paid by the business is based upon the average number of persons employed, or upon the gross receipts of its business, it shall estimate the average number of persons to be employed in its business, or the gross receipts of its business, as the case may be, for the period to be covered by the return. This estimate, if accepted by the bureau as a reasonable one, shall be used in determining the amount of tax to be paid by the business; provided, however, the amount of the tax so determined shall be tentative only, and such business shall, within thirty days after the expiration of the period for which a tax certificate may have been issued, furnish the bureau with a statement under penalty of perjury upon a form furnished by it, showing the exact number of persons employed in such business, or the exact gross receipts of such business, as the case may be, during the period of such certificate, and the tax for such period shall be finally ascertained and paid in the manner provided by this title for the ascertaining and paying of renewal of certificates for other businesses, after deducting from the payment found to be due, the amount paid at the time such first certificate was issued. The bureau shall not issue to any such business another certificate for the same, or any other business, until that business shall have furnished to it the written statement and paid the tax as hereinabove required. (Ord. 1984-5, § 13, 1984; prior code § 39.01).</text>

        <heading>CONSTITUTIONAL APPORTIONMENT.</heading>
        <text>None of the business taxes provided for in this chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitution of the United States and the State. In any case where a business tax is believed by a business tax certificate holder or applicant for a business tax certificate to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he or she may apply to the Tax Collector for an adjustment of the business tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within one year after the payment of the prescribed business tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show his or her method of business, his or her gross receipts, and such other information as the Tax Collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The Tax Collector shall then conduct an investigation and, after having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the business tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory or, if the business tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the business tax so fixed. In fixing the business tax to be charged the Tax Collector shall have the power to base the business tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the business tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the business tax as prescribed by the provisions of this chapter. Should the Tax Collector determine the gross receipts measure of business tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of the applicant's business in the City or at the end of each fiscal year, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of business tax therefore; provided, however, no additional business tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the business tax certificate holder shall have paid an amount equal to the annual business tax as prescribed in this chapter. (Ord. 2010-2 § 2, 2010).</text>

        <heading>ASSESSMENT OF CORRECT TAX.</heading>
        <text>The Tax Collector may review any return filed pursuant to this chapter and may request or inspect any documents or accounts as provided for in this title or in rules and regulations promulgated pursuant to this title to determine what the correct tax due is. If the Tax Collector determines that too much tax was paid, he or she shall cause the overpayment to be paid to the business affected within 10 days. If he or she determines that too little tax was paid, he or she shall require immediate payment of the additional amount due, plus a penalty of fifty percent of the additional amount due. If the payment is not made within ten days of notice to the business of the additional amount due, the Tax Collector shall report the matter to the tax review committee pursuant to Chapter 5.18.

          <text>In enacting this chapter, the City Council recognizes that commercial massage therapy is a professional pursuit which can offer the public valuable health and therapeutic services. The City Council further recognizes that, unless properly regulated, the practice of massage therapy and the operation of massage businesses may be associated with unlawful activity and pose a threat to the quality of life in the local community. Accordingly, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect the public health, safety, and welfare by providing for the orderly regulation of businesses providing massage therapy services, discouraging prostitution and related illegal activities carried on under the guise of massage therapy, and establishing certain sanitation, health, and operational standards for massage businesses.</text>

          <text>Furthermore, it is the purpose and intent of this chapter to address the negative impacts identified in the City Council's findings to reduce or prevent neighborhood blight and to protect and preserve the quality of City neighborhoods and commercial districts; and to enhance enforcement of criminal statutes relating to the conduct of operators and employees of massage businesses.</text>

At the discretion of the prosecuting attorney, any action brought to abate a public nuisance or violation or to seek compensation for damages may also include as a party the owner of the real property that is the site of the use or activity causing the nuisance. It is the express intention of this section to permit the prosecution of real property owners who fail to take reasonable steps after notice to correct nuisances or violations existing on their property even though the property may be leased to others.

        <heading>FINDINGS—NUISANCE DECLARED.</heading>
        <text>In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declarations:</text>
        <text>The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, including highways, except as expressly permitted in this chapter, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

          <text>First Response. Upon a report of an unruly or potentially unruly gathering, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City may respond to the incident and make a preliminary determination as to whether the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering. If the officer or employee determines that the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may issue a written warning to the person apparently in charge of the gathering that contains information in substantial conformance to the following:</text>

          <text>"Ambient" means the average sound level during a six-minute period as measured with a precision sound level meter, using slow response and "A" weighting. The sound level shall be determined with the noise source at issue silent and in the same location as the measurement of the noise level of the source or sources at issue. If for any reason the alleged offending noise source cannot be shut down, the ambient noise must be estimated by performing a measurement in the same general area of the source but at a sufficient distance that the noise from the source is at least 10 dB below the ambient so that only the ambient level is measured. If the difference between the ambient and the noise source is five to nine dB, then the level of the ambient itself can be determined by subtracting a one dB correction to account for the contribution of the source.</text>

          <text>REQUIREMENTS. An annual license fee shall be paid for every dog or cat over the age of four (4) months owned or harbored in this city that has adopted the provisions of this ordinance. Said annual license fee shall be first due when the animal reaches four (4) months of age or within 60 days after the dog or cat is acquired, and due on the anniversary date of the original purchase date each year thereafter. New residents shall have sixty (60) days in which to acquire such license. Persons renewing their license shall have thirty (30) days following their due date before being delinquent and having to pay a late penalty. The fee for such license shall be as set forth in Section 8.02.290. The fee paid for the licensing of spayed or neutered dogs or cats shall be less than said license fee for unaltered dogs or cats upon presentation of the proper certification. The license fee paid by persons over the age of 60 shall be at a discount. For purposes of this section any surcharge on the license fee imposed under Section 8.02.290 shall not be considered part of the license fee. Any person who shall fail to pay such license fee after said fee is due, or said dog or cat is required to be licensed, shall in addition to paying any past due license fee or fees, also pay a penalty in accordance with Section 8.02.290. A license shall be obtained, but no license fee shall be payable for the licensing of any dog being raised, trained or used to assist handicapped persons (such as those provided by Canine Companions) including but not limited to any dog which is being trained for guide or hearing purposes by a resident of the City or used for guide or hearing purposes by a handicapped resident of the City and which has come from a guide or hearing dog training facility such as Canine Companions, or for dogs which have served as a member of the armed forces of the United States of America, or any dog used by a local law enforcement agency for the purposes of crime prevention or control. Dog or cat licenses are not transferable between owners; however, if the dog or cat dies and the owner acquires a new dog or cat, the license is transferable to the new dog or cat. The license does not have to be renewed until the original purchase anniversary date. The fee paid for a dog or cat license is not refundable.

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The City Council, having completed a lengthy study of social services in San Mateo, including issues of child protection, finds that it is necessary and appropriate that non-profit corporations working with children in the City of San Mateo check the criminal backgrounds of their employees and volunteers who will be alone with children and/or who have supervisory or disciplinary control over children.</text>
        <text>The City Council finds that children are vulnerable to adults having authority over them and that it is important for children to be protected and for parents to be better assured that children enrolled in non-profit programs are protected. (Ord. 1996-25, § 1, 1996).</text>

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The purpose of this chapter is to address the adverse effects caused by persons congregating along busy city streets to solicit work. This activity has brought increased traffic to already congested areas, causes drivers along these streets to be distracted, and results in vehicles making unsafe stops so the vehicle driver or occupant can discuss employment with workers. Additionally, workers will from time-to-time dart out into the street to solicit employment, creating a safety hazard to themselves and the motoring public. The regulations enacted in this chapter are intended to eliminate these safety hazards. (Ord. 2003-9 § 3, 2003).</text>

        <heading>INTENT—PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>This chapter is adopted because the City has been forested with a variety of healthy and valuable trees which must be protected and preserved, the preservation and reforestation of which is necessary for the health and welfare of the citizens of this city in order to preserve the scenic beauty; maintain property values; prevent erosion of topsoil; protect against flood hazards and the risk of landslides; counteract the pollutants in the air; maintain the climatic balance and decrease wind velocities; and relieve the public costs of installing and maintaining stormwater drainage systems. To this end it is reasonable to expect property owners to maintain their trees in a satisfactory condition to keep the City of San Mateo as a sylvan place to live.</text>
        <text>It is the intent of this chapter to establish regulations for the protection, removal and preservation of heritage trees within the City in order to retain as many trees as possible consistent with the purpose hereof and the reasonable economic enjoyment of private property. (Ord. 2007-1 § 3; Ord. 2005-3, § 1, 2005; Ord. 2004-6, § 1, 2004; Ord. 1997-24 § 1, 1997; Ord. 1984-7 § 1, 1984; Ord. 1968-35 § 3, 1968; prior code § 65.50).</text>

Said procedure shall be had until such franchise is struck off, sold and awarded to a bidder who shall make the necessary deposit of at least ten percent of his or her bid therefor, as herein provided. Such successful bidder shall deposit with the City Clerk, within twenty-four hours of acceptance of his or her bid, the remaining ninety percent of the amount thereof, and in case he or she has then failed to do so, then such deposit theretofore made, shall be forfeited, and such award of such franchise shall be void, and such franchise shall then and there by council be again offered for sale to the highest bidder or bidders therefor, in the same manner, and under the same restrictions as hereinbefore provided, and in case such bidder has failed to deposit with the City Clerk the remaining ninety percent of his or her bid within twenty-four hours after its acceptance, the award to him or her shall be forfeited, and no further proceedings for a sale of such franchise shall be had, unless the same is readvertised and again offered for sale, in the manner hereinbefore provided.

        <heading>PRIORITIES IN MODULAR NEWSRACKS.</heading>
        <text>At such time as this Ordinance becomes effective, the Director shall begin the process of replacing Freestanding Newsracks with Modular Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area. For this initial replacement process, space within Modular Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area shall be assigned in the following order of priority:</text>
        <para>
          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Priority amongst Publishers desiring space in the Area shall be based on a lottery system conducted by the Director. The number of available compartment spaces shall be determined applying the criteria set forth in Section 17.12.030. A random selection from all of the participating Publishers for each non-site specific space shall be made by rounds. At such time as a Publisher has determined it has sufficient space for its needs, its name shall be eliminated from subsequent rounds. When the number of remaining rounds is the same as the original number of participating Publishers, the Director shall ask if any Publishers have yet to receive any compartment space. All Publishers who have yet to receive any compartment space shall then be given one compartment space. Any remaining spaces shall be randomly selected by rounds, as before, until there are no remaining spaces. A second random selection shall determine the specific location that each space will be assigned. Trading, selling, giving or other method of transferring assigned space to another Publisher, person or entity shall not be allowed. Any Publisher desiring additional space after the lottery process is complete shall be placed on the priority list discussed in subsection (d) below.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(b)</num>
          <text>Alternative Method. As an alternative to the lottery system, all participating Publishers may present to the Director an agreed upon distribution plan for the available spaces in the Mandatory Modular Area. If approved by the City Council applying the criteria set forth in Section 17.12.030, this agreed upon distribution plan will become the basis for the initial modular assignments.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(c)</num>
          <text>Vacancies. A Publisher with assigned compartment space may at any time return such space to the City by stating in writing its intent to do so. The City, or its Operator, shall thereafter remove the compartment and replace it with that of the next in line Publisher, or a space keeper box if there is no one on the priority list.</text>
        </para>
        <para>
          <num>(d)</num>
          <text>Priority List. A priority list shall be created by the Director for the determination of assignment of compartment space as vacancies occur after the initial modular assignments under subsection (a) or (b) above. Priorities when vacancies occur in Modular Newsracks shall be established in the following order: (1) Publications maintaining permitted Free Standing Newsracks within the Mandatory Modular Area on June 18, 2002, that were not able to secure the desired number of spaces in Modular Newsracks as a result of the lottery procedure implemented pursuant to Subsection (a)., above, or were not included in any stipulated plan implemented under Subsection (b), above. If there are more than one Publication meeting this definition, priority within such group shall be based upon whichever historically has maintained Freestanding Newsracks in the Mandatory Modular Area for the longest period of time; (2) other Publications shall be given priority based upon the chronological sequence of the submittal of permit applications ("first-come, first-served" basis).</text>
        </para>
        <text>Priorities shall be recorded on a priority list maintained by the Director. Placement on the priority list shall entitle the Publisher to the next available vacant space when its name comes to the top of the list. If the Publisher declines the next available space, it may rather choose to be placed at the bottom of the priority list. If thereafter the Publisher desires additional spaces, its name shall be placed again at the bottom of the list and another space provided when its name comes up again. A Publisher who is not then currently on the priority list may be placed on the list at any time by filing a permit application for Compartment space within the Mandatory Modular Area. As an alternative to being placed upon the priority list, a Publisher may choose to apply for a new Modular Newsrack location under section 17.12.060 (b)(2). (Ord. 2004-2 § 1, 2004; Ord. 1995-4 § 3, 1995).</text>

If an event is planned in response to a contemporaneous public event or decision which could not have been known in advance, the applicant may file an application 48 hours before the event.

The failure to submit a timely acceptance or appeal is deemed an automatic withdrawal of the application. If the applicant files a valid written acceptance and complies with the general permit conditions, the permit issues upon the chairperson's receipt of the written acceptance. The chairperson shall notify the applicant, the City Council, the City Manager, and any affected department head that the permit has been issued consistent with the notification process identified in the special event procedures.</text>

In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates or may purchase the property with knowledge that it is within the special flood hazard area.</text>

The City requires that the need for the alternate design standard be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting an alternate design standard, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.</text>

          <text>Applicability. Alternate design standards may be approved for new construction or, substantial improvements necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of this chapter are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood, does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. The alternate design standard criteria set forth in this section pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. An alternate design standard may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.</text>

All cut and fill surfaces created by a grading process, agricultural processes excepted, shall be planted with a ground cover that is acceptable to a soils engineer and compatible with ground covers in general use in the area, and is one that will thrive with little or no maintenance once established. Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes to a depth sufficient to support the proposed plant materials in a manner acceptable to a soils engineer. On slopes likely to be extensively disturbed by later construction, an interim ground cover may be planted or emplaced to be supplemented by the permanent ground cover and/or shrubs and trees when the site is finally developed and landscaped. When slopes have been permitted too steep to support continuous ground cover, and in lieu thereof niches and ledges have been provided for planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be landscaped and graded so as to blend into the natural surroundings. All plant materials shall be satisfactory to the superintendent of parks and/or City Engineer.</text>

        <text>Subject to the property owner's consent, a noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for any commercial message or any other noncommercial message provided that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this Title. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted. This provision applies to all chapters within this Title. (Ord. 2009-2 § 1, 2009).</text>

        <text>In interpretation and application, the provisions of this title shall be held to minimum requirements, except where they are expressly stated to be maximum requirements. It is not intended to impair or interfere with any private restrictions placed upon property by covenant or deed; provided, however, that where this title imposes a greater restriction upon the subdivision of land than is imposed or required by such private restrictions, the provisions of this title shall control.</text>
        <text>Whenever any provision of this title and any other provision of this code, or resolution of any kind, imposes overlapping or contradictory regulations with respect to the subdivision of land, or contains any restrictions covering any of the same subject matter, that provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards or requirements shall govern.</text>
        <text>Whenever requirements are set forth in general terms in this title, the details of such requirements may be set forth in policies adopted from time to time by the Planning Commission and/or the Council. (Ord. 1969-8 § 1, 1969; prior code § 139.05).</text>

        <heading>GUIDING PRINCIPLES.</heading>
        <text>In the application of these regulations, consideration will be given, within the established framework of local streets, to the provision of uniformity of street widths where appropriate and for a properly relating alignment of street names. Preservation of the privacy and safety of streets in residential areas shall be encouraged by the prevention of through traffic in such areas. The width and design of the streets required shall be directly related to the vehicular and pedestrian traffic-generating characteristics of the anticipated uses of the abutting land. Traffic capacities shall be provided to meet anticipated external travel needs, where appropriate. The number of intersections on thoroughfares shall be kept to a minimum consistent with the basic needs of ingress and egress. Intersections shall be so designed as to provide optimum safety for pedestrians and motorists and other users of the streets. Provisions shall be made for assuring adequate light, air and privacy on all parcels of property regardless of the land use. Topography and vegetation of exceptional character shall be respected, and streets shall be designed so as to prevent excessive grading and scarring of the landscape. Special care shall be taken in the design and construction to provide stable soil and subsoil conditions. Problems of drainage shall be resolved in such manner as to provide substantial security against excessive runoff or flooding, earth movements and excessive erosion.

          <text>Calculation. Private Park and Recreational Facility Space credit is calculated by first dividing the cumulated park and recreation facility space that qualifies for credit by the total park land dedication requirement and then by multiplying this result by the maximum credit allowable. For example:</text>
        </para>
        <text>If the cumulated amount of Park and Recreational Facility Space that qualifies for credit = 5,000 square feet (SF), and</text>
        <text>Park land dedication requirement = 15,000 SF, and</text>
        <text>The maximum allowable credit = 50%, then:</text>
        <text>5,000 SF / 15,000 SF = .333</text>
        <text>Therefore .333 x 50% max = 16.65% credit for project off of the fee.</text>

      <section>

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The conversion of residential, commercial and industrial structures from single person or entity ownership to condominiums, stock cooperatives, or community apartments with multiple ownership interests creates special community problems, both social and economic. Given the relative lack of rental construction over the past eight years, conversions may significantly affect the balance between rental and ownership housing within the City (which may affect future economic growth); reduce the variety of individual choices of tenure, type, price, and, location of housing; increase overall rents; decrease the supply of rental housing for low and moderate income persons and families; and disregard the needs of the prevailing consumer market. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidelines to evaluate those problems, the impact any conversion application may have on the community and to establish requirements which shall be included in any conversion approval. (Ord. 1983-12 § 1, 1983; Ord. 1981-33 § 1, 1981; Ord. 1979-22 § 3, 1979).</text>

        <text>The Council may adopt by resolution from time to time a developer's contribution policy to be applied in zoning and land-use administration. New or changed developments often place an increased demand upon public facilities. When additional, new, or expanded public improvements are needed to support a new or changed land use or development, these improvements should be paid for on an equitable basis by the developer. New land-use projects should not require the expenditure of tax moneys to support the project development. The required improvements should be compatible and in continuity with adjacent, or tributary, public improvements. The land use or development, its users and the public, should receive legitimate benefits from the construction of new or upgraded public facilities. (Ord. 1987-11 § 1; Ord. 1981-18 § 1)</text>

          <text>The purpose of the CBD District is to encourage the development and re-use of existing downtown structures as a center for retail, cultural, entertainment, and community service uses. Pedestrian activity should be strongly encouraged at the ground floor level, while upper floor office and residential uses should be encouraged to promote active daytime and nighttime use of the downtown area. Amenities that will enhance the downtown environment for public and public oriented uses shall also be encouraged.</text>

          <text>For the areas in the required retail frontage area as designated by the Downtown Plan, it is intended that ground floor retail and service uses with windows be provided to maintain downtown's commercial vitality and continuity within the retail core. Uses within this area should enhance the pedestrian scale of the downtown core and allow for a compact walking environment in which all shopping opportunities are easily accessible. It is intended that all uses in this area maintain ground floor visibility to serve patrons on an unannounced or drop-in basis, conduct a majority of their business face-to-face on the premises with their customers, and maintain retail storefronts comparable to traditional retail sales operations, including display of goods and services for sale.</text>

It is the intent of these regulations to insure the continued growth and development of the downtown area, thereby enabling it to remain an important retail, cultural, entertainment, business, financial, and medical center of the City and of mid-San Mateo County. Residential uses will be encouraged by increased housing densities in the downtown area in order to provide a wide range of housing opportunities for growing number of downtown employees, as well as existing residents.</text>

          <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
          <text>This special permit is intended to enable and encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate use; to allow diversification in the relationship of various uses, structures and space; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space; to offer recreational opportunities close to home; to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural green spaces, and to counteract the effects of urban congestion and monotony. The proposed development must be designed to provide an environment of a stable and desirable character, and must provide permanently reserved useable open space and areas for off-street parking adequate for the occupancy proposed. In residential development, it must include provision for open space and recreation areas to meet the needs of the anticipated population. (Ord. 1971-41 § 1, 1971; prior code § 152.09(I)(A)).</text>

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The City Council finds that adult entertainment businesses, because of their very nature, are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods. The primary purpose of this chapter is to prevent the concentration or clustering of these businesses in any one area. (Ord. 1980-18 § 1, 1980).</text>

        <heading>FINDINGS AND INTENT.</heading>
        <text>The Council finds that the community's standard of care and maintenance of real property in the City is significantly higher than the standard established by Titles 7 and 10 of this code for creation of a public nuisance. It is, therefore, a matter of public concern when a site for an approved development is allowed to deteriorate for a period of time before construction begins even if it does not become a public nuisance under this code. This chapter is intended to provide the enforcement power to compel and the incentive otherwise lacking for the owner and the project developer to maintain the property at a level consistent with the neighboring properties and its condition at the time of the project approval. These measures are needed to prevent unnecessary loss of tax revenues and park in-lieu fees caused by the depreciating effect of the site's condition, to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the City, and to safeguard the aesthetic standards of the community.

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>The purpose of this chapter is to enhance the quality of life in San Mateo by the provision for appropriate design of landscaping and through the preservation of existing trees. Landscaping shall be a major component of all site design in order to create a city that has a strong landscaped character. The intent is that individual neighborhood character be developed and maintained, architecture be softened by plant materials where appropriate, conflicting uses be buffered, parking areas be screened, comfortable outdoor living and walking spaces be created, air pollution be mitigated and future developments be made water efficient.

        <text>The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning code is based on the division of the entire City into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this title as "special uses" and fall into three (3) categories:</text>

        <heading>POWER TO GRANT.</heading>
        <text>Power to grant a special use permit shall be limited to those uses designated as "special use" within the districts established under this title. Other nondesignated uses which the Planning Commission concludes are so similar to any specifically allowed use in the district as to be virtually identical thereto in terms of impact and land use requirements may also be allowed as special uses. The appropriate approval body shall have the power to hear evidence that the granting of such permit will or will not adversely affect the general health, safety and/or welfare of the community, and that the use, if permitted, will not cause injury or disturbance to adjacent property traffic or by excessive noise, smoke, odor or noxious gas, dust, glare, heat or fumes, or industrial waste. Any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of an existing approved special use shall require a review by and be final with the Planning Commission, unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with Section 27.08.060. Any use designated as a "special use," but which does not currently have a special use permit, shall be required to procure a special use permit from the appropriate approval body for any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of the use.

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>It is the policy of the City of San Mateo to provide persons with disabilities reasonable accommodation in regulations and procedures to ensure equal access to housing, and to facilitate the development of housing for persons with disabilities. This chapter is based on requirements of Federal and State housing laws, including the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and implements the housing element of the City's General Plan.</text>
        <text>The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure under which a person with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning regulations in order to secure equal access to housing, and outlines a process for decision makers to act upon such requests. This chapter is intended solely for residential use and is distinct from the requirements for a variance.</text>
        <text>The City also recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing residential neighborhoods, as articulated in the City's General Plan, and will consider whether the requested reasonable accommodation would result in an undue burden to the City or a fundamental alteration of City policies.
