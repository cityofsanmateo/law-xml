      <heading>FINDINGS—NUISANCE DECLARED.</heading>
      <text>In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the State of California under <cite doc="Cal. Veh. Code" path="§22660">Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code</cite> to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings and declarations:</text>
      <text>The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles, or parts thereof, on private or public property, including highways, except as expressly permitted in <cite path="7.17">this chapter</cite>, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of <cite path="7.17">this chapter</cite>.</text>

      <text><cite path="7.22">This chapter</cite> is enacted pursuant to the authority provided in <cite doc="Cal. Gov't Code">Government Code</cite> Sections <cite doc="Cal.

        <text>First Response. Upon a report of an unruly or potentially unruly gathering, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City may respond to the incident and make a preliminary determination as to whether the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering. If the officer or employee determines that the incident constitutes or may constitute an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may issue a written warning to the person apparently in charge of the gathering that contains information in substantial conformance to the following:</text>

If, after a first notice has been given as provided above, a duly authorized officer or employee of the City responds to a gathering that is then an unruly gathering, the officer or employee may take such further abatement steps as the officer or employee believes reasonable to abate the unruly gathering as provided by State and City laws. The response costs of those abatement steps may be compiled and reported to the City Manager for hearing and assessment of the response costs against the property owner as provided in <cite path="7.42">Chapter 7.42</cite>.</text>

Accordingly, if an entertainment permit contains the warning stated herein, the permittee shall be liable under the provisions of <cite path="7.22">this chapter</cite> for the costs of responding to and abating an unruly gathering at a permitted establishment if the abatement requires an emergency response.</text>

      <text>The City reserves the right to terminate sewer service for noncompliance with the provisions of <cite path="7.38">this chapter</cite> which reasonably appear to present an imminent endangerment to health, safety, and welfare of persons, or to the environment.

Such termination shall be effective immediately, but shall be reviewed pursuant to the hearing process provided by the City. The Director shall allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Director that the period of endangerment has passed, and provisions have been made to prevent future occurrences of actual or threatened discharges which may result in endangerment to individuals, the environment, damage to facilities, or NPDES permit violations.</text>
