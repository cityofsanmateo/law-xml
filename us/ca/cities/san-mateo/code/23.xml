        <text>The application, plans, specifications, computations and other data filed by an applicant for permit shall be reviewed by the building official or his designees. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of this jurisdiction to verify compliance with any applicable laws under their jurisdiction.

        <text>When a permit is issued for required plans, the building official shall endorse in writing or stamp the plans and specifications "APPROVED." Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified or altered without authorizations from the building official, and all work regulated by this code shall be done in accordance with the approved plans.</text>
        <text>The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this code. No building permit for construction of a superstructure shall be issued unless a complete superstructure application is made not later than 90 days after issuance of a foundation permit and a superstructure permit is taken out not later than six months after issuance of the foundation permit.

Before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained to do so, and the fee therefor shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work and provided further that such suspension or abandonment has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit over one year after expiration, the permittee shall pay a new full permit fee.</text>

If the Fire Chief determines that any on-site fire protection facilities are being maintained in such manner as not to meet national standards, he or she shall order the owner to make such repairs, alterations or additions as shall conform the facilities to national standards. The Fire Chief shall designate a reasonable time within which such repairs, alterations or additions are to be made and it is unlawful for any person so ordered willfully to fail or refuse to comply with such order. A copy of the order of the Fire Chief shall be served upon each tenant. Without limiting the foregoing, the willful failure or refusal to comply with such an order constitutes an occupancy violation within the meaning of the applicable provisions of the building code.</text>

In examining this requirement, the City will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for 50 to 100 years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates or may purchase the property with knowledge that it is within the special flood hazard area.</text>

The City requires that the need for the alternate design standard be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting an alternate design standard, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.</text>

        <text>Applicability. Alternate design standards may be approved for new construction or, substantial improvements necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of <cite path="23.33">this chapter</cite> are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damage during the base flood, does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. The alternate design standard criteria set forth in this section pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. An alternate design standard may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of <cite path="23.33">this chapter</cite> would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners.</text>

Such drains or terraces shall be permanently lined or protected with materials approved by the City Engineer and accumulating surface waters shall be conducted to an approved point of discharge. Any such terrace or intercepting drain shall be designed to prevent overflow which may cause erosion. All exposed slopes of any cut or fill subject to erosion shall be protected by approved planting, crib walls, walls and planting, terracing, or a combination thereof.

Topsoils are to be stockpiled during rough grading and used on cut and fill slopes to a depth sufficient to support the proposed plant materials in a manner acceptable to a soils engineer. On slopes likely to be extensively disturbed by later construction, an interim ground cover may be planted or emplaced to be supplemented by the permanent ground cover and/or shrubs and trees when the site is finally developed and landscaped. When slopes have been permitted too steep to support continuous ground cover, and in lieu thereof niches and ledges have been provided for planting, such slopes need not be planted with a continuous ground cover, but may instead be screened with vines and plantings. Cuts and fills along public roads may be required to be landscaped and graded so as to blend into the natural surroundings. All plant materials shall be satisfactory to the superintendent of parks and/or City Engineer.</text>

"Special precautions" may include, but shall not be limited to, specifying a flatter exposed slope, construction of additional drainage facilities, berms, terracing, compaction, or cribbing, installation of plant materials for erosion control, or implementation of other relevant BMPs: and reports of a registered soils engineer and/or of a registered engineering geologist whose recommendations may be made requirements for further work.</text>

On large operations or where unusual site conditions prevail, the City Engineer may specify the time of starting grading and time of completion, or may require that the operation be conducted in specific stages so as to insure completion of protective measures or devices prior to the advent of seasonal rains.</text>
