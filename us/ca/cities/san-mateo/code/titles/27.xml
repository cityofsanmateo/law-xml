      <heading>DEVELOPER CONTRIBUTIONS.</heading>
      <text>The Council may adopt by resolution from time to time a developer's contribution policy to be applied in zoning and land-use administration. New or changed developments often place an increased demand upon public facilities. When additional, new, or expanded public improvements are needed to support a new or changed land use or development, these improvements should be paid for on an equitable basis by the developer. New land-use projects should not require the expenditure of tax moneys to support the project development. The required improvements should be compatible and in continuity with adjacent, or tributary, public improvements. The land use or development, its users and the public, should receive legitimate benefits from the construction of new or upgraded public facilities.</text>

      <text>The planning commission may grant floor area bonuses for the provision of open space in R5 developments if such open space is provided for recreational purposes and is intended to meet the needs of the inhabitants. In determining the suitability of the proposed open space, the following shall be considered:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>The park and recreation element of the general plan;</text>
      </para>

        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>Such other factors and considerations which bear a reasonable relationship to the need for open space.</text>
      </para>
      <text>The open space and recreation facilities will be analyzed as part of the required site plan and architectural review (SPAR) and may be granted a bonus by recommendation of the approval body if these facilities are found to meet the recreational needs of the project residents as being adequate in size and number.</text>
      <text>To earn a floor area bonus for any project feature, a development must earn a bonus from each of the three categories below in this section. In order to earn any bonus provision, a development must include increased natural landscaping. However, not more than twenty-five percent (25%) of natural landscaping in pots or planters shall be counted for the purpose of determining the amount of any floor area bonus.</text>
      <text>Open space and recreation facilities may be located in required yards under the conditions provided in the open space bonus standards.</text>
      <text>The following project features may qualify for floor area ratio bonuses when the criteria are met:</text>
      <para proof="true">
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Outdoor Open Space. Open space bonuses may be granted for provision of natural landscaping, court games and field sports areas as follows:</text>

          <num>(a)</num>
          <text>Each two percent (2%) of net parcel area devoted to natural landscaping or water features may be granted a floor area ratio bonus of 0.1, up to a maximum of 0.8. In order to qualify for a bonus, the natural landscaping or water feature must be provided in addition to the required yards and be open to the sky. The minimum bonus required is 0.35.</text>
        </para>
        <para>

          <text>For each court game a floor area ratio bonus of 0.05 may be granted, up to a maximum of 0.1.</text>

      <heading>PURPOSE AND EFFECT OF DEVELOPMENT AND/OR USE PURSUANT TO THIS CHAPTER.</heading>
      <text>This chapter is intended to regulate residential care facilities with seven (7) or more residents in addition to the caregiver. Residential care facilities serving six or fewer residents, in addition to the caregiver, are permitted in all zoning districts that permit single family residences and shall not be required to meet any requirement of this chapter. Any zoning plot developed or used pursuant to this chapter shall not thereafter be used for any purpose other than a residential care facility unless and until the Zoning Administrator has certified in writing that the alternate use satisfies all applicable and then existing land use regulations pertaining to the classification of the zoning plot.</text>

      <heading>PURPOSE—INTENT.</heading>
      <para>
        <num>(a)</num>
        <text>The purpose of the CBD District is to encourage the development and re-use of existing downtown structures as a center for retail, cultural, entertainment, and community service uses. Pedestrian activity should be strongly encouraged at the ground floor level, while upper floor office and residential uses should be encouraged to promote active daytime and nighttime use of the downtown area. Amenities that will enhance the downtown environment for public and public oriented uses shall also be encouraged.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(b)</num>
        <text>In order to insure that these purposes will be carried out, a basic set of regulations establishing maximum permitted floor area, building setback requirements, maximum height and bulk, minimum open space standards, and required retail ground floor uses have been set forth.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(c)</num>
        <text>For the areas in the required retail frontage area as designated by the Downtown Plan, it is intended that ground floor retail and service uses with windows be provided to maintain downtown's commercial vitality and continuity within the retail core. Uses within this area should enhance the pedestrian scale of the downtown core and allow for a compact walking environment in which all shopping opportunities are easily accessible. It is intended that all uses in this area maintain ground floor visibility to serve patrons on an unannounced or drop-in basis, conduct a majority of their business face-to-face on the premises with their customers, and maintain retail storefronts comparable to traditional retail sales operations, including display of goods and services for sale.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(d)</num>
        <text>The Central Business District zoning district will be restricted to those properties within a parking assessment district. It is the intent of these regulations to insure the continued growth and development of the downtown area, thereby enabling it to remain an important retail, cultural, entertainment, business, financial, and medical center of the City and of mid-San Mateo County. Residential uses will be encouraged by increased housing densities in the downtown area in order to provide a wide range of housing opportunities for growing number of downtown employees, as well as existing residents.</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(e)</num>
        <text>It is the intent of these regulations to encourage development of higher intensity than in other parts of City in order to create the concentration of development and activity appropriate to a major business center. Development intensities should vary by subarea to minimize impacts on adjacent areas, moderate transportation and parking requirements, preserve essential physical characteristics of the primary shopping area, conserve architectural, historical and natural values and make new residential development possible.</text>

        <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
        <text>This special permit is intended to enable and encourage flexibility of design and development of land in such a manner as to promote its most appropriate use; to allow diversification in the relationship of various uses, structures and space; to facilitate the adequate and economical provision of streets and utilities; to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open space; to offer recreational opportunities close to home; to enhance the appearance of neighborhoods through preservation of natural green spaces, and to counteract the effects of urban congestion and monotony. The proposed development must be designed to provide an environment of a stable and desirable character, and must provide permanently reserved useable open space and areas for off-street parking adequate for the occupancy proposed. In residential development, it must include provision for open space and recreation areas to meet the needs of the anticipated population.</text>

      <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
      <text>The City Council finds that adult entertainment businesses, because of their very nature, are recognized as having objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. Special regulation of these businesses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods.

      <heading>FINDINGS AND INTENT.</heading>
      <text>The Council finds that the community's standard of care and maintenance of real property in the City is significantly higher than the standard established by Titles 7 and 10 of this code for creation of a public nuisance. It is, therefore, a matter of public concern when a site for an approved development is allowed to deteriorate for a period of time before construction begins even if it does not become a public nuisance under this code. This chapter is intended to provide the enforcement power to compel and the incentive otherwise lacking for the owner and the project developer to maintain the property at a level consistent with the neighboring properties and its condition at the time of the project approval. These measures are needed to prevent unnecessary loss of tax revenues and park in-lieu fees caused by the depreciating effect of the site's condition, to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the City, and to safeguard the aesthetic standards of the community.</text>

      <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
      <text>The formulation and enactment of a comprehensive zoning code is based on the division of the entire City into districts in each of which are permitted specified uses that are mutually compatible. In addition to such permitted compatible uses, however, it is recognized that there are other uses which it may be necessary or desirable to allow in a given district but which on account of their potential influence upon neighboring uses or public facilities need to be carefully regulated with respect to location or operation for the protection of the community. Such uses are classified in this title as "special uses" and fall into three (3) categories:</text>
      <para>
        <num>(1)</num>
        <text>Use either municipally operated or operated by publicly regulated utilities or uses traditionally affected by public interest;</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(2)</num>
        <text>Uses entirely private in character which, on account of their peculiar locational need, the nature of the service they offer to the public, and their possibly damaging influence on the neighborhood, may be established in a district or districts in which they cannot reasonably be allowed as an unrestricted permitted use under the zoning regulations; and</text>
      </para>
      <para>
        <num>(3)</num>
        <text>Nonconforming uses which as special use permits can be made more compatible with their surroundings.</text>

      <heading>POWER TO GRANT.</heading>
      <text>Power to grant a special use permit shall be limited to those uses designated as "special use" within the districts established under this title. Other nondesignated uses which the Planning Commission concludes are so similar to any specifically allowed use in the district as to be virtually identical thereto in terms of impact and land use requirements may also be allowed as special uses. The appropriate approval body shall have the power to hear evidence that the granting of such permit will or will not adversely affect the general health, safety and/or welfare of the community, and that the use, if permitted, will not cause injury or disturbance to adjacent property traffic or by excessive noise, smoke, odor or noxious gas, dust, glare, heat or fumes, or industrial waste. Any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of an existing approved special use shall require a review by and be final with the Planning Commission, unless appealed to the City Council in accordance with <cite path="§27.08.060">Section 27.08.060</cite>. Any use designated as a "special use," but which does not currently have a special use permit, shall be required to procure a special use permit from the appropriate approval body for any physical alteration, physical expansion, or change of the use.</text>

      <text>It is the intent of the following planning policy to insure that all service stations in the City of San Mateo be constructed and operated in a manner appropriate to the various districts and without detriment to the appearance of the immediate vicinity and to the City as a whole.</text>
      <text>This policy is intended to represent minimum standards of aesthetic suitability and to establish minimum standards for development of service stations in the City of San Mateo.</text>
      <text>Meeting these design review standards shall not be construed as a sole justification for the granting of a special permit. All other requirements of the zoning ordinance must be met for review and consideration by the Planning Commission. Any action by the Planning Commission is subject to review by the City Council.</text>

    <heading>REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR RESIDENTIAL USES</heading>
    <section>
      <num>27.79.010</num>
      <heading>PURPOSE.</heading>
      <text>It is the policy of the City of San Mateo to provide persons with disabilities reasonable accommodation in regulations and procedures to ensure equal access to housing, and to facilitate the development of housing for persons with disabilities. This chapter is based on requirements of Federal and State housing laws, including the Federal Americans with Disabilities Act, the Federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act, and implements the housing element of the City's General Plan.</text>
      <text>The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure under which a person with disabilities may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of zoning regulations in order to secure equal access to housing, and outlines a process for decision makers to act upon such requests. This chapter is intended solely for residential use and is distinct from the requirements for a variance.</text>
      <text>The City also recognizes the importance of sustaining and enhancing residential neighborhoods, as articulated in the City's General Plan, and will consider whether the requested reasonable accommodation would result in an undue burden to the City or a fundamental alteration of City policies.</text>
